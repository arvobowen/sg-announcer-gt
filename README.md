# SpiderGate Orb Module: Announcer - GitHub to Teams

This is a SpiderGate Orb that requires the dependancy `spider-gate` to run.  A simple and efficient Node.js application that listens for new GitHub releases and automatically posts formatted notifications to designated Microsoft Teams channels. It's designed to differentiate between full releases and pre-releases, routing notifications accordingly.
